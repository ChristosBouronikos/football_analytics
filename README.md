# Edd Webster's Football Analytics Projects
A collection of football analytics projects, data, and analysis by [Edd Webster](https://twitter.com/eddwebster)

Within the notebooks repository, analysis is split in the following sections:
- <b>A) Data Parsing / Web Scraping</b> - acquisition of data from various sources including Wyscout, StatsBomb, FBref, TransferMarkt, and Understat
- <b>B) Data Engineering</b> - cleaning of the data, fuzzy matching of distinct datasets
- <b>C) Data Analysis</b> - analysis of the data in Python (notebooks to be added - 07/09/2020)

Scraped / cleaned data is made available where possible. Some data sources are a little large to be uploaded to GitHub, however, all notebooks in this repository go through and explain the code that will allow you to acquire this data.

Please see [public.tableau.com/profile/edd.webster/](https://public.tableau.com/profile/edd.webster/) for Tableau visualisations and dashboards of the data in acquired, cleaned and fuzzy-matched in this repository.
