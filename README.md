# Edd Webster's Football Analytics Projects
Collection of football analytics projects, data, and analysis by [Edd Webster](https://twitter.com/eddwebster)

Within the notebooks repository, analysis is split in the following sections:
- <b>data parsing / web scraping</b> - acquisition of data from various sources including Wyscout, StatsBomb, FBref, TransferMarkt, and Understat
- <b>data engineering</b> - cleaning of the data, fuzzy matching of distinct datasets
- <b>data analysis</b> - analysis of the data in Python (TBA)

Scraped / cleaned data is made available where possible. All notebooks in this repository can help you acquire the data.
